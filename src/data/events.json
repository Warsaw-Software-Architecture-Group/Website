    "longDescription": "Join us for an in-depth exploration of microservices architecture patterns that are transforming how we build scalable applications. This session will cover practical implementation strategies, common pitfalls, and real-world case studies from large-scale systems.\n\nWe'll explore the Saga pattern for managing distributed transactions, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for separating read and write operations, and Event Sourcing for maintaining application state through immutable event logs.",
